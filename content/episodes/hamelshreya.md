### What's cool about this is you don't need to do this many, many times. For most p

### People have been burned by evals in the past. People have done evals badly, so t

### A term that you used in your posts that I love is this idea of a benevolent dict

### Thank you for having us.

### Sure. Evals is a way to systematically measure and improve an AI application, an

### So just to make very real, so imagining this real estate agent, maybe they're he

### Okay. I like what you said first, which is we had a very broad definition. Evals

### And so we have all the different components and pieces and information that the 

### Amazing. That's so cool.

### Yeah. Yeah, it's really cool. And you see all of these different sort of feature

### Hamel Husain (00:18:32):

### Yeah, and you don't have to do it for all of your data. You sample your data and

### Yeah, so what do you do with something like that?

### This is more of, "Hey, we're not handling this interaction correctly. This is mo

### It's amazing you're catching that, too, here. Otherwise, you'd have no idea this

### Yeah, it's supposed to be chill. Just don't overthink it. And there's a way to d

### One common question that we get from people at this stage is, "Okay, I understan

### Do you think we'll get to a place where an agent can do this, where it has that 

### Lenny Rachitsky (00:25:17):

### Okay, maybe Hamel cover that, actually.

### And so benevolent dictator is just a catchy term for the fact that when you're d

### Hamel Husain (00:27:42):

### Yeah. It's going to be okay. It's not perfection. You're just trying to make pro

### Hamel Husain (00:29:14):

### So, okay. So let's say we do, and Shreya and I, we recommend doing at least 100 

### ... in data analysis and qualitative analysis called theoretical saturation. So 

### Shreya Shankar (00:31:34):

### Yeah. Okay. So you did 100 of these. Now you have all these notes. So this is wh

### Just reviewing traces. At least there's one job left for now. Great.

### Yes. Creating axial codes, so what it does is-

### Lenny Rachitsky (00:34:39):

### And this is what LLMS are really good at, taking a bunch of information and synt

### Lenny Rachitsky (00:36:43):

### It's interesting the tools don't do this, or do they try and they just don't do 

### "... do this." I do think it's a little bit hard, right? Part of this whole expe

### Amazing. Okay. What's funny about you guys doing this is I just want to go do th

### Yeah. So I pulled up a video just to drive home Shreya's point. We are not inven

### ... be really fun. Two, I love that my podcast episode just came out today is in

### Okay. So you can do this through anything, and the same thing works just fine in

### And so basically, what you could do is you can categorize your traces into one o

### Yeah. Or have it with 10 other words.

### Yeah, okay. What are some of those other words that people often use that you th

### Lenny Rachitsky (00:43:17):

### It's in the loop. Still space for us. Great.

### Lenny Rachitsky (00:44:04):

### Yeah. It's absurd to feel like you wouldn't know this is happening. Watching thi

### Okay. So here's sort of the big unveil. This is the magic moment right now. So w

### So just to try to mirror back what you're describing, you want to test what your

### Absolutely. You nailed it.

### And the goal here is just to have a suite of tests that run before you ship to p

### Lenny Rachitsky (00:52:04):

### Awesome. Okay. Hamel's got an example of an actual LLM as a judge eval here, so 

### It's wild how much drama there is in the evals space. We're going to get to that

### You're going through manually, you do that.

### As a product manager or someone, even if you're not doing this calculation yours

### Lenny Rachitsky (01:00:56):

### That is interesting. Your advice is not skip straight to evals and LLM as judge 

### This is one of the coolest research reports you can possibly read if you want to

### That's the best name for a researcher.

### We did this super fun study when we were doing user studies with people who were

### Yeah, okay, great. You still got to do product the same way, but now you have th

### It's not that many, because a lot of the failure modes, as Hamel said earlier, c

### Probably the ones that are most risky to your business if they say something lik

### But it's a lot of one-time cost. Right now, forever, you can run this on your ap

### What comes next after you've built your LLM judge? Well, we find that people jus

### Okay, great segue to a debate that we got pulled into that was happening on X th

### I think that works. There's two things to that, right? One is they're standing o

### We'll also say that coding agents are fundamentally very different than other AI

### The other thing is, yeah, engineers have a dogfooding personality. There are ple

### Dogfooding is a dangerous one, only because a lot of people will say they're dog

### Yeah, okay. What I'm hearing is you consider A-B tests as part of the suite of e

### Just to add to the previous question a little bit, why is there this debate, A-B

### If you just call it, "We're just doing error analysis, doing data science to und

### Yeah, they don't correlate with math problem-solving, sorry to say.

### The fact that your course on Maven is the number one highest grossing course in 

### It gets me every time. The Internet's so inconsistent. My favorite thing was yes

### Shoot, many humans are still great. I think that's great news.

### Those are the top two? Okay.

### Oh, those are definitely... Then, I guess the third one I would add is, there's 

### Sweet, so don't be scared. Use LLMs as much as you can throughout the process.

### Yeah. Let me actually share my screen, because I want to show something. To pigg

### Amazing. A question I didn't ask, but this is I think something people are think

### Yeah, it's really not that much time. I think people just get overwhelmed by how

### Something I want to make sure we cover before we get to a very exciting lightnin

### Yeah, I can talk about the syllabus a little bit, and then Hamel can talk about 

### Hamel Husain (01:36:20):

### I have no idea. I just take one month at a time. I don't know where we're going 

### Yeah, maybe 30 seconds. Do you guys train it on the voice mode, by the way? That

### Yeah, sign up for the course and then you'll get a bunch of emails. Everything w

### Bittersweet, bittersweet. Incredible. Okay. With that, we've reached our very ex

### I like to recommend a fiction book because life is about more than evals. Recent

### They're down the street, him and Berkeley.

### Super cool. Oh, man, nerds, I love it. Okay, next question. Favorite recent movi

### Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:30):

### I feel like everyone goes through that. Eventually in their life they decide, I 

### Lenny Rachitsky (01:40:58):

### Worth it. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite product you've recently di

### Yeah, I really like Claude Code and I like it because I feel like the UX is outs

### There we go. Okay, two more questions. Hamel, do you have a favorite life motto 

### I like that. For me, it's to always try to think about the other side's argument

### Amazing. Final question. When I have two guests on, I always like to ask this qu

### Yeah. My favorite thing about Hamel is his energy. I don't know anybody who cons

### Yeah, it's pretty easy to find me. My website is Hamel.dev. I'll give you the li
