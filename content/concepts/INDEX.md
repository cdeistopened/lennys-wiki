```

## Next Steps

- **Link Related Concepts**: Add cross-links between related concepts in the "Related Concepts" section
- **Expand Descriptions**: Add more detailed context about each concept
- **Episode Linking**: Verify that episode wikilinks resolve to actual episode pages in `content/episodes/`
- **Category Tags**: Consider adding category tags to group concepts thematically

## Notes

- Two concepts share the same base name: `product-market-fit` (11 mentions) and `product-market-fit-2` (6 mentions) for "Product-market fit"
- Some entries include conversational fragments (e.g., "It's", "Yeah", "Okay") which may be noise from transcript extraction
- Episode links use the names from the concepts.json entity index
